## Branch rules — read before touching git

| Branch | Rule |
|--------|------|
| `master` | Upstream mirror — **never modify, never push to origin** |
| `linux-port` | Active port branch — all work goes here |
| `fork/linux-port` | Your GitHub fork — push here when phases complete |

Always verify you are on `linux-port` before editing:
```bash
git -C xformer10 rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

---

## Build

```bash
cd /home/coalis/ClaudeCodeProjects/XFormer/xformer10
cmake -B build-linux -S . && cmake --build build-linux -j$(nproc)
# binary: build-linux/xformer10
```

Dependencies: `libsdl2-dev`, `libsdl2-ttf-dev`

## Canonical source list

The live C source list is the `add_executable(xformer10 ...)` block in **`CMakeLists.txt`** (root level). That is the single source of truth for what compiles.

**`src/CMakeLists.txt` is stale** — it references files that don't exist (`atari16.vm/blitter.c`, `xatari.c`, `xfcable.c`, `xsb.c`, `encrypt.c`). Do not use it as a manifest.

**Dead code — do not port or budget time for:**
- `src/atari8.vm/atariosb.asm`, `x6502.asm`, `xeroms.asm` — the 3 `.asm` files are unreferenced by the modern build; the portable `x6502.c` is the live 6502 core.

## Key files added or substantially modified by the port

**New files (did not exist in upstream):**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/main_linux.c` | Linux entry point, SDL2 event loop, 70 Hz throttle |
| `src/ddlib_sdl.c` / `ddlib_sdl.h` | DirectDraw → SDL_Texture shim; `GetSDLRenderer()` / `GetSDLWindow()` accessors |
| `src/menu_sdl.c` / `menu_sdl.h` | SDL2 dropdown menu bar (File/VM/Window/Disk) |
| `src/sdl_filebrowser.c` / `sdl_filebrowser.h` | Modal SDL2 file browser (replaces zenity) |
| `src/keymap_sdl.c` | SDL scancode → PS/2 scan code mapping |
| `src/stubs_linux.c` | Win32 stubs that are no-ops on Linux |
| `src/compat_win.h` | Win32 type/macro compatibility layer |
| `src/compat_winfile.h` | Win32 file API compatibility |

**Substantially modified from upstream:**

| File | What changed |
|------|-------------|
| `src/ddlib.c` | DirectDraw surface management gutted; now delegates all rendering to ddlib_sdl.c |
| `src/sound.c` | waveOut backend replaced with SDL audio (PulseAudio via SDL) |
| `src/gemul8r.c` | Linux menu integration, `LinuxPickFile()`, SDL_DROPFILE drag-and-drop |

## Linux/Pi runtime rules

**Never use `getuid()` or `id -u` to derive socket paths.** The terminal runs as effective UID 0 while the graphical session is UID 1000. UID-based paths produce `/run/user/0/...` which doesn't exist.

- Use `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` when available, with a glob fallback: `/run/user/*/pulse/native`
- For PulseAudio diagnosis: `PULSE_LOG=99 ./build-linux/xformer10` — libpulse prints the exact socket path it tries.

## Known bad logic paths — do not repeat

These were discovered during 5+ failed attempts to fix screen jitter (Phases 14–19). Each one consumed one or more iterations without progress.

**1. SDL_RENDERER_PRESENTVSYNC is a no-op on Pi OS under both Wayland and X11/XWayland.**
The compositor does NOT pass vsync signals to application windows on either backend. `SDL_RenderPresent` returns in 0–2 ms regardless of PRESENTVSYNC flag. Do not rely on it for frame pacing. Use `clock_nanosleep(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, TIMER_ABSTIME, ...)` for the throttle. See also rule 8 (measured proof) and rule 9 (DRM vblank also doesn't fix jitter).

**2. SDL_Delay is useless for sub-jiffy timing on Pi.**
Pi OS runs a 250 Hz kernel tick (4 ms minimum sleep quantum). `SDL_Delay(1)` sleeps ~4 ms, not 1 ms. A throttle loop that relied on `SDL_Delay(1)` calls ran at ~50 fps instead of 60 fps. Use `clock_nanosleep(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, TIMER_ABSTIME, ...)` for ~100 µs precision.

**3. Measure actual fps BEFORE investigating root causes.**
All 5 jitter-fix attempts were implemented before the actual frame rate was confirmed. One telemetry line (avg/min/max frame ms) would have exposed the 50 fps problem immediately and saved 3 iterations.

**4. Do not oscillate on renderer flags without a falsifiable hypothesis.**
`SDL_RENDERER_PRESENTVSYNC` ↔ `SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED` was toggled 3+ times with no measurement step between changes. Always measure before and after; never change a flag twice.

**5. `vi.qpfCold` and `vi.qpcCold` must be initialized before any throttle code runs.**
`GetCycles()` divides by `vi.qpfCold`. On Linux, `WinMain` is never called, so both values are 0. ARM integer divide-by-zero silently returns 0, making `GetCycles()` always return 0 and causing the `fBrakes` throttle to spin forever. Always initialize both via `QueryPerformanceFrequency` / `QueryPerformanceCounter` before `InitProperties()`.

**6. `fBrakes` must be set to TRUE at Linux startup.**
`fBrakes = TRUE` is only in `WinMain` (gemul8r.c:1615). On Linux, the global is 0 (FALSE = turbo mode) until explicitly set. Add `fBrakes = TRUE;` in `main()` before `InitProperties()`.

**7. Do not chase rendering pipeline or timing if the emulation pixel data itself may be wrong.**
Defender shows garbled pixels — a data-corruption symptom, not a timing symptom. Timing fixes cannot fix wrong pixel values. When garbled/corrupted pixels are reported, investigate the rendering data path (pvBits content, palette lookup, stride) before frame-rate or VSYNC code.

**8. SDL_RENDERER_PRESENTVSYNC under X11/XWayland is also a no-op on Pi OS.**
Measured with `SDL_GetRendererInfo` + timed `SDL_RenderPresent`: the OpenGL renderer reports `vsync=YES` (flags=0xe) but `SDL_RenderPresent` consistently returns in 0–2 ms. XWayland queues frames without blocking on vblank. Do not rely on PRESENTVSYNC for frame pacing under any compositor on Pi OS.

**9. DRM vblank wait does not fix scroll jitter on Pi OS.**
`drmWaitVBlank(card1, DRM_VBLANK_RELATIVE, 1)` on `/dev/dri/card1` (vc4-drm HDMI controller) builds and runs correctly but produces no observable improvement in Pogo Joe, Joust, or Defender. Frame delivery is already phase-correct; the remaining jitter is in the emulation content (wrong pixel data produced by xvideo.c), not in how frames reach the display. Do not add further frame-delivery timing mechanisms — investigate emulation accuracy instead.

## Ralph loop workflow

Each phase has its own directory (`phaseN/`) containing five files:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `SPEC.md` | Immutable goal, DoD, constraints, known facts |
| `PLAN.md` | Immutable ordered gated steps |
| `PROGRESS.md` | Mutable agent log; first line is `STATUS: IN_PROGRESS / COMPLETE / BLOCKED` |
| `PROMPT.md` | Per-iteration Claude instructions |
| `ralph.sh` | Driver script |

**Running a loop:**
```bash
cd /home/coalis/ClaudeCodeProjects/XFormer/phaseN
./ralph.sh                          # defaults: Sonnet 4.6, MAX_ITER=25, COOLDOWN=5s
MAX_ITER=10 MODEL=claude-opus-4-8 ./ralph.sh
```

`ralph.sh` refuses to run unless `xformer10` is on `linux-port`. Stops on `STATUS: COMPLETE`, `STATUS: BLOCKED`, or 2 consecutive Claude failures. Each iteration logs to `phaseN/logs/iter-NN-*.log`.

**Draft review rule:** always show the user SPEC.md / PLAN.md / PROMPT.md drafts for review before writing them. Do not chain step writes without explicit user opt-in.

## Security / GitHub notes

- `.rom` files in `src/atari8.vm/` (ataribas.rom, atariosb.rom, atarixl.rom) are inherited from the upstream MIT repo — not added by this port.
- No credentials, API keys, or secrets belong in this repo. The `.gitignore` covers build artifacts; no `.env` patterns are needed.
- The `fork` remote uses SSH (`git@github.com`). The `origin` remote is HTTPS read-only to the upstream.
