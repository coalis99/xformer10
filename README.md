Xformer 10, the Atari 800 emulator for Windows 10, 7, and now 11!

It is the 10th generation of the Xformer (pronouned "Transformer") series of
Atari 800 emulators first developed in 1986 for the Atari ST.  The name is a
nod to electrical engineering and the concept of impedance matching; not unlike
how an emulator transforms non-native instruction sets and hardware.

This 10th version of Xformer (first released on 10-10-2018) adds Windows tablet
and touch-screen support, "tiled mode", "roulette mode", and "time travel" mode.
It is also the first natively built Atari 800 emulator for Windows on ARM, and
the only Atari 800 emulator granted permission by Atari Corp. to use Atari ROMs.
